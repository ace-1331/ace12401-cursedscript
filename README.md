# DOCUMENTATION FOR THE SUBMISSIVES AND SLAVES SCRIPT

The design philosophy behind **SASS**: The goal is for it to only affects the wearer but others may interact with it making it opt-in only. It tries to reduce spam and stay mysterious while it informs the wearer of changes. It provides multiple settings to personalize the experience and make it compatible with multiple wearers. It is meant to complement the club and RP, it is not meant to replace any of it! The use of RP along with **SASS** is encouraged, this is why there won't be many features related to things that can already be done. (Tie up x, etc.) Most features will revolve around things that cannot be done at the moment to enhance the experience and give D/s more tools. It tries not to use anything a player cannot already do therefore it will not feature anything that might be considered "cheats". (Examples of what it will never have: escape button, infinite money, reputation change, etc.)

Please use the commands in whispers. Reduce spam as much as you can, make sure to turn it off if it ever gets stuck and notify me ASAP.

**WARNING: be careful when using the curse in a beta release/NEW VERSION**

**Last approved on the following versions: R59**

Bug fixes and improvements will come, thank you for reporting them. Never downgrade and stay up-to-date! You need to remove the extension and re-load it with the newest zip file when updating. Make sure to refresh your club page before using a new version.

- You may get an error while loading the unpacked extension saying the manifest is missing or broken. This means the manifest.json file was in the wrong format after decompression/cloning. Please open the file in notepad and save it again to save it with the proper encoding.

- This extension will work on other Chromium-based browsers that support dev extensions. So it will work on mobile browsers like Yandex or Kiwi. (Use Total Commander file app to fix the manifest bug)

- IMPORTANT NOTE ON RUNNING THE SCRIPT: make sure you are on a validated version of the game and I urge you to use it carefully. Do not cause any grief, spam, etc. Disable it when it is inappropriate. If there seems to be negativity around it, I will not keep it open for the public.

## Useful information
- ALL COMMANDS ARE PREFIXED WITH THE COMMAND CHARACTER AND THE SLAVE IDENTIFIER, BY DEFAULT IT IS # AND YOUR NAME (IE. #ace help or #ace showowners)
- ALL PARAMETERS MUST BE SPLIT BY A SPACE (IE. #ace belt)
- The commands are now toggles. (ie: #ace cursedmittens will trigger it on or off depending on the current state of that curse)
- Supports OOC and is case insensitive
- The command can be preceded or followed by any text. What's important is that the whole command follows each other [this works #ace showstrikes, this #ace showstrikes also works, #ace this doesnt work showstrikes, #ace showstrikesthis wont work]
- If an item is blocked in your permissions, it will not clash with the curse, but it will not be used. Unblock the needed items to use them with the curse.
- You can save your currently worn colors so the curse can remember
- Not compatible with old browsers. (Welcome to 2020!)
- Some things that will be coming are listed in the repository's wiki. Feel free to send your own suggestions, and report bugs on discord or in the issue tracker of the repo
- Some more intense features are intentionally hidden behind the intense version, if you wish to use them, do so at your own risk as some may block freedoms completely.

- IMPORTANT NOTE ON PERSISTANCE: To have your configurations persist between sessions, you need to be on the same device/browser. However, there is an import and an export function available to use. Run `cursedExport()` in the console and save the whole string it gives you wherever you want. On the other browser/device you can use the command `cursedImport('yourgivenstringhere')` to import your configs. (The string must be surrounded by `'` not `"`) This will allow you to carry over your configurations between versions of the club, devices or browsers. This also means, clearing your browser data without saving your configurations will erase your curse data!
