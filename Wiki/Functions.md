- **ðŸŒŸ:** A commonly used and liked feature
- **Beta or In development:** Functions still undergoing tests and changes during a beta, be wary of potential weird bugs.
- **Avoid:** Those are functions that either are currently bugged, or that are scheduled to disappear in the future.

### Access level:
- **Wearer:** Designate the wearer as being able to use the function on herself
- **Public:** Public level of access, anyone can use it on the target. Some public functions can be disabled by the wearer's mistresses
- **Mistress:** Mistress level of access, gives more control but the most restrictive functions are still not open. Includes Public
- **Owner:** Owner level of access, pretty much everything outside of a handful of functions are usable. Includes Mistress and Public
- **Club owner:** Club owner level of access, only one exists and is the one who have her collar on your neck. Can do anything she wishes and includes every other access level except Wearer

## Speech

Anything regarding how your speech is controlled is found there. Some of these options are mutually exclusives, or can cause soft locks if used together. Be thoughful about what you apply on the wearer. Speech rules do not work with OOC and most will not impact emotes or whispers.

| listsentences | Action | Gives the list of sentences you have at your disposal |  |  | Wearer, Owner |

Remember this when you give forced sentences to say as you might prevent the person from speaking entirely!

| enforceentrymessage | Rule | Toggle if the cursed person need to speak a sentence upon entering a room |  |  | Owner |
| entrymessage | Setting | Gives the sentence that must be spoken upon entering a room with the rule above. Note that the sentence should respect the rules on speech given to be able to be said, and it could be problematic if there are several owners present |  |  | Owner |

| target [Target ID] [Target] | Setting | Defines a new target for the 'talk' command. Target ID is the tag you use and Target, the word used. Having the Target empty allows to delete a given ID |  | X | Owner |

| enablesound | Rule | Variation on the sentence above, limits to one sound or its variation, as shown below |  | X | Owner |
| sound [Sound] | Setting | Defines an allowed sound. Allows some punctuation such as .',!?- as variation for the curse bearer. A sound only requires letters to be in the same order, so 'bark' would also allow 'baaaaaark' or 'bark?' but not 'brak'  | ðŸŒŸ | X | Owner |
| retype | Setting | The wearer will no longer need to retype the whole message when it contains a transgression |  |  | Owner |

## Practical

Not to be confused with the similar command in the Access section of this doc |  | X | Public |
| changestrikes [Number] | Action | Allows more control on adding or removing strikes than 'punish' and 'reward'. Number can be negative |  |  | Mistress |

## Fun functions

While not linked to the effect of the curse directly, those functions are available to those with it active for some fun time with friends

| Function | Type | Effect | Status | Intense | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| draw [Number of cards] [Player] | Action | Draw cards from a 52 cards deck. If the deck is empty, it shuffles automatically.

| shuffle | Action | Shuffle the deck of cards |  |  | Wearer |


## Built-in club rules
**IMPORTANT, THESE NEED TO BE ENABLED BY THE CLUB OWNER, AND ARE NOT DISABLED IF THE CURSE IS TURNED OFF**

This is because it isn't the curse saving this, but the character, being functions present in the base game. These functions are merely shortcuts for the Club owner instead of opening the interaction menu, but also to allow more people to toggle them on.

| Function | Type | Effect | Status | Intense | Access |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| forcedlabor | Action | Send the target to work as a maid, to serve drinks in rooms |  |  | Owner |
| remoteself | Setting | Prevents the use of remote on your own vibrators |  |  | Owner |
| remoteblock | Setting | Prevents the use of remote on any vibrators |  |  | Owner |
| unlockself | Setting | Blocks the use of keys on your own bindings |  |  | Owner |
| keyblock | Setting | Removes the use of keys entirely |  |  | Owner |
| blockchange | Setting | Removes access to the wardrobe entirely |  |  | Owner |


# Examples of use

Not all functions are easy to make use correctly, so some example uses are given. Note that you pretty much are required to be two, except for Wearer level functions, so it could be a good idea to go in a private room to experiment, and take notes of what works for you and what doesn't without being spammed with outside messages.

As a reminder, you use a command with #[Name of the person you are whispering to, or your name if a wearer function] [Function name] [Parameters, if any]. In our case, we will assume we are targeting a character named "Target", who is the only one who need the Curse installed. The functions will be applied as they go so to stay coherent if you do these all in order. You can copy these and replace the name to follow this tutorial with a friend / victim to get an idea on how it work.

We assume you are using Intense mode, as the more complex functions tends to require it. You can read these examples even if you do not plan on using intense mode.

#Target wardrobev2

This function should be used by Target. This gives access to an upgraded wardrobe, and is the typical example of a toggle function. Using it again will remove access to it. But really, this alone is a good enough reason to use the curse.


**#Target owner [ID]**

Again, Target is the one using this function and gives almost full access to the other person. You need to give their ID so the final result should be like *#Target owner 12401*


**#Target showowners**

Both can use this function, it will confirm that your new owner has been set correctly. If you made a mistake and the wrong number was added, you can redo the same command you did previously to remove the owner: *#Target owner 12401*


**#Target nickname [NewName]**

The new owner can now define her visible name for Target. Note that this won't change the name to use for commands!


For the next command, put a binding on Target's torso, such as a harness.

**#Target curseitem torso 1**

The harness on Target will be cursed for one hour. Target should try to remove it to understand the effect. If no number is provided, the curse will remain forever until it is lifted. Note that wearers can also use this function, but they must specify a number of hours.

The following examples use the advanced functions related to restrained speech. It's a good example on how to use the feature, but most importantly, it is a good way of understanding curse commands in general.

**#Target restrainedspeech**

The Owner using this on Target will limit her ability to speak. Trying should punish Target


**#Target talk**

Target need to use this. When using this, normally the command will fail. However, take a note of what is displayed. This should help you understand what you are missing


**#Target listsentences**

With Target using this, a list of allowed combinations of sentences will be given. Assuming the default ones, we will put this into practice

**#Target talk miss leave**

Now Target should be saying something akin of "May I be excused, miss?"


With this, we will now clean everything to start from a clean slate

**#Target restrainedspeech** (only if you activated it doing the Intense part)

**#Target curseitem torso** (if the item is still cursed)

**#Target deletenickname [ID]**

Are used by the owner and then

**#Target owner [ID]**

By Target

From this, you are at your starting point and can start using the curse


These examples should be enough to understand the principle.
